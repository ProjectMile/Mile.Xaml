# Mile.Xaml Versioning

This document applies to all versions of Mile.Xaml.

## Version Format

- Simple Version: `<Major>.<Minor> <Tag>`
  - Example: `9.0 Preview 1`
- Binary Version: `<Major>.<Minor>.<Build>.<Revision>`
  - Example: `9.0.2654.0`

## The rule for build and revision number

The build number is the number of days since September 12, 2021 because the 
first version of Mile.Xaml is created and published on that day.

The revision number is the number of releases releases in the day corresponding
to the build number, and it counts from zero. So the first revision is 0 and 
the second revision is 1.
