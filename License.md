### The philosophy about open-source software from Kenji Mouri (MouriNaruto)

- The source code from the third-party projects should be distributed under 
  their original licenses to give the maximum respect for the upstream 
  projects.

- Don't make your software open source if you don't want your source code or
  ideas used in proprietary software. Because they always have the way to cross
  restrictions if they really want to do, even you distributed your source code
  under the strictest copyleft license, they can use clean room to resolve it.

- I prefer permissive licenses because using copyleft licenses will make you
  feel anxious in most cases because you always need to worry about someone
  using your source code in proprietary software. So, I choose to give the
  maximum respect to users, and I also hope people can try their best to treat
  others kindly.
