### The philosophy about open-source software from Kenji Mouri (MouriNaruto)

```
You shouldn't make your software open source if you don't want your source code
or ideas used in proprietary software. Because they always have the way to cross
restrictions if they really want to do, even you distributed your source code
under the strictest copyleft license, they can use clean room to resolve it.

Use copyleft licenses make you feel anxious because you always need to worry
about someone uses your source code in proprietary software. So, I choose to
give the maximum respect to users and I also hope every people treat others
kindly.
